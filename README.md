# Quiz Application Backend (Monolithic)

This project is monolithic because all features (questions, quizzes, evaluation) are bundled in a single Spring Boot app; it can be refactored into microservices by separating them into independent services (e.g., Question Service, Quiz Service, Evaluation Service) with REST communication.

A **Spring Boot monolithic backend** for a quiz application.  
It provides REST APIs to manage questions, create quizzes based on category, and evaluate quiz submissions.  

This project demonstrates clean architecture with **Spring Boot, Spring Data JPA, MySQL, REST APIs, and Lombok**.
