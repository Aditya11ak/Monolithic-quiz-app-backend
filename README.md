# Quiz Application Backend 


A **Spring Boot monolithic backend** for a quiz application.  
It provides REST APIs to manage questions, create quizzes based on category, and evaluate quiz submissions.  

This project demonstrates clean architecture with **Spring Boot, Spring Data JPA, MySQL, REST APIs, and Lombok**.



## üèóÔ∏è Monolithic vs Microservices

This app is **monolithic** because all features (questions, quizzes, evaluation) run in a single Spring Boot service.  
It can be converted to **microservices** by splitting into independent services (Question Service, Quiz Service, Evaluation Service) communicating via REST.
